## What is Phenix

Phenix is an open source real time path tracer built upon Nvidias OptiX API.
Primarily I am creating this to serve as a testbed for future research but will keep a clean
and maintained version for public consumption. Its name "Phenix" was chosen because to begin
this project I scavenged what I could from a previous project "Helios". However Helios has
some very ugly code to say the least as we made with under a short deadline. Therefore Phenix
is metaphorically burning this old ugly code and rising majestically from its ashes.

## TODO
1. Inspector menu - to maintian a list of scene objects
2. ~~Importing of meshes~~
3. Geomtry interface
4. Better sampling than jitter
5. More materials and material editor
6. Installation guide!!!
7. OSD?!?!

Have any ideas? Feel free to submit a pull request or send me over an email.
