Phenix is an open source reat time path tracer built upon Nvidias OptiX API.
Primarily I am creating this to serve as a testbed for future research but will keep a clean
and maintained version for public consumption.

## TODO
1. Inspector menu - to maintian a list of scene objects
2. Importing of meshes
3. Geomtry interface
4. Better sampling than jitter
5. More materials and material editor
6. Installation guide!!!
7. OSD?!?!

Have any ideas? Feel free to submit a pull request or send me over an email.
